###Task AA-test

10,000 tests need to be done, at each iteration form subsamples of 500 users from groups 2 and 3 and run t-tests.
Made a distribution histogram, calculate what percentage of p-values turned out to be less than or equal to 0.05.
Made a conclusion.

`period: from 2022-11-25 to 2022-12-01`

`groups: 2 and 3`

`H0: split system works correctly.`



###Task AB-test

Analyze the results of the experiment, groups 1 and 2 are involved.
Group 2 used one of the new algorithm, group 1 was used as a control.
Made a conclusion and give a recommendation. 

`period: from 2022-12-02 to 2022-12-08`

`groups: 1 and 2`

`H0: new algorithm in group 2 will lead to an increase in CTR`



###Task AB-test2

Analyze the test between _groups 0 and 3_ according to the metric of linearized likes. 
Is the difference visible? Has _p-value_ gotten smaller?

Analyze the test between _groups 1 and 2_ according to the metric of linearized likes. 
Is the difference visible? Has _p-value_ gotten smaller?


`period: from 2022-12-02 to 2022-12-08`

`groups: 0 and 3, 1 and 2`
